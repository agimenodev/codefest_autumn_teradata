##### CodeFest Manifesto #####

What’s Hackfest/Codefest principle ?

It is an event during which computer programmers and others involved in software and hardware development, including graphic designers, interface designers and project managers, collaborate intensively on software projects in competition with other teams.

So, borrowing some concepts, we are gonna start our codefest, but instead of a competition that lasts one day, our goal will be different.
Time line: Folks!!!! There is no deadline and no homework !!!

What’s the goal: In our daily work we are encapsulated to specific technology attach to specific project, so having these small projects we can get break out of our chains and explore new … (too much start trek here).

So to make it short: Learn & Discovery & fun

When: Once a week

How long?: One hour

What do I need? Bring your laptop, there is a vagrant image ready for you ;)

Methodology: All of us will be coding on own computer, every session will be lead with the expertise on the specific technology that we will be working on. **Any question please speak up, so we can all share and learn. **

Autumn CodeFest

For this first codefest our project will be an address book.

```The Recipe book : Vagrant + MongoDB + NodeJS + ReactJS + docker + deployment```
